I have a new and insanely great idea which I will try implementing tomorrow. Basically, its going to be a bookmarklet and clicking it will parse the page and extract all the files used, generate a HTML5 Cache Manifest, encode it as a Data URL and open up a iframe or window with the manifest parameter set and then the site will be cached for offline!

Actually, this looks technically impossible. That sucks. Same Origin rules suck.
