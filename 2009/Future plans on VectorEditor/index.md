I don't really care about VectorEditor, If someone finds it useful and wants to take over it, well, I'm not really updating it. Not many people are updating it, and once svgweb is mixed with svg-edit for 95% browser penetration and rotation works, it will be able to do everything VectorEditor does and more.

Sure it makes the project quite fragmented, a Richdraw version, an OnlyPaths version, a VectorEditor version, and now a svg-edit one. But each one will hopefully be mostly compatible with each other (mostlyish)
