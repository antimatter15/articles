Since all news nowadays comes from twitter, I promised myself I would make something to keep up on the new tweets since I'm no longer an active user or follower. And BTW, don't follow me (until i say so or something).

So it's a jetpack add-on that queries twitter using it's JSON API every 3.14159 minutes. It uses the Jetpack notification API to display new items whenever they come up.
