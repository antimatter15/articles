So I just tried Safari 4 Beta, and I'm quite impressed, but it's strange that it's almost exactly like Chrome. It's like Chrome's not only based on Webkit, but Webkit is based on chrome. Sorta like Vista = OS X, Gadgets/Widgets, Search/Spotlight stuff.
I'm somewhat annoyed about not being to close tabs with middle click, and how, unlike Firefox+TabKit, it only has that small possible tab space. Especially since I have a dysfunctional mental garbage-collection system, so I easily have &gt;20 tabs at a time.
