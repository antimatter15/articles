Actually, it doesn't delete frames quite yet, but only blank out keyframes and turn them back into tweens, but true deleting is in the works. So it's actually toBlank, which is sort of a misnomer since it doesn't make things blank, but rather to whatever state it feels like.

**Edit: **Okay, so now it has full deleting of keyframes, tweens, and not blanks cause there's no point in deleting what doesn't exist.
