So I was reading through some long-ish articles, and logically, I stare at the scrollbar to get a rough estimation of where I am in reading it.

But, the horrible thing called comments and a *gasp* theme, makes the page appear FAR longer than the article. I think that browsers, with the new &lt;section&gt; &lt;header&gt; and whatever that's in HTML5 should interpret these markings and create a smarter scrollbar like how Chrome does the statusbar with little yellow markings where occurances are found. There should be ones which indicate the end of the article, start of comments, etc.

And I've noticing how I'm talking about Google for just about every new post. I think that's just abou where all the innovation is right now. Or at least all the innovation that I use and know about that gets popularized by media.
