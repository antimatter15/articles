So I built this interesting brainf*ck interpreter which offloads most (not all) of the arithmetic operations (it concatenates tons of +1s into some more interesting operations). It could easily be made to offload all operations, but then it becomes a bit too prolonged and boring, so for +1s, and +0s, the computer handles the task.

It's fitted with a Hello World app, which takes quite a bit to start, but then it quickly types out the message.
