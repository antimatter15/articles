[![](Screenshot2.png "Screenshot")](Screenshot2.png) I'll take the liberties of plagarizing this as who wouldn't recognize its source?

So I'm moving the small totally unknown and 1-2 file things that I've spammed Google Code with previously. Small things like js-xdb, mental-interpreter, js-tpl-engine, js-xdomain, subleq2, vxjs-ajax (a whole project for a single function? crazy stuff).

So i'm shrinking my google code profile to reduce my spamminess, becasue I used to feel like it would be awesome to have a project for everything I spent more than 2 minutes on doing in hopes that someone would eventually find it interesting.

Hopefully someone would find it interesting on github.

I'm also adding some lost projects, like my backups of stuff that got lost when appjet shut down, a substition code cracker a few jetpacks and still adding more.

[http://github.com/antimatter15/antimatter15/tree/master](http://github.com/antimatter15/antimatter15/tree/master)

Those are all the tiny projects not big enough to deserve a actual repo or google code project page.
