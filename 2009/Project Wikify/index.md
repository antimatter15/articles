Imagine applying the collaborative wiki content model to all static content on the internet, allowing the community to exchange ideas, update content, fix errors, parody, and improve the internet as a whole.

Project Wikify is a bookmarklet that enables full-page contentEditable, and provides a way for multiple users to interact on the page. It is a platform for open, collaborative parody online and greatly reduces the level necessary for critique.
