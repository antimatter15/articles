So I decided to mix up an old project, which I was *almost* about to migrate to GitHub but it's still on Google Code ([http://code.google.com/p/datastore-service/](http://code.google.com/p/datastore-service/)) which was basically a free service that allows easy prototyping of things by providing basic persistence (using JSONP). So I mixed it up with the Ajax Animator Standalone Player, so the Google Wave version of the ajax animator will have a Publish button which will upload things to a server and give you a shareable URL Such as [http://antimatter15.com/ajaxanimator/player/player.htm?1e025941543678](http://antimatter15.com/ajaxanimator/player/player.htm?1e025941543678) while it would be great if a) the URL was shorter and b) the URL was more customizable, it works basically.
