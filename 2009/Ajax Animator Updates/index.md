I'm going to soon upload the first update to the Ajax Animator in over a year. It is basically VectorEditor integration, and is not an actual update, but a fork of the project.

Ideally VectorEditor (as a far simpler and smaller project), is more stable and the Recovery systems which are quite prominent in the v0.20.x. So the recovery mechanisms are not implemented.

Feature wise, the version has very few new features. It has a few new features like fill opacity and line opacity, and showing multiple layers. But apart from that, there is almost nothing.

It is *not* format compatible with r13 (v0.20.x) of the format, so importing from those will not work.
