I was running my ajax animator for a hour playing a relatively large animation, and my computer totally died. I tested it again, and within ~2 minutes RAM usage was up to 1.1GB. I looked it up https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.0/+bug/380318 I guess i'm lucky with 4GB of ram, so it lasted maybe a few minutes longer than it should have.

At least it's not a ajax-animator flaw, just a firefox one.
