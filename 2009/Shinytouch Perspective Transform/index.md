**Shinytouch perspective transforms now work!**

One big issue with ShinyTouch is that it didn't transform points correctly, but now it has been totally resolved by stealing [this](http://wiiwhiteboard.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/wiiwhiteboard/source/linux/perspective.py?revision=1.2&amp;content-type=text%2Fplain) (MIT licensed) from the linux (python!) port of Wiimote Whiteboard (Johnny lee's famous work). Now it works totally insanely awesomely, no elitists necessary.
