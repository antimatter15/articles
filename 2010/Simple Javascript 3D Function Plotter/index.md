I think function plotters are cool, and since 3d is all the hype nowadays, why not make a 3d function plotter? I like how WolframAlpha does it quite nicely, but it doesn't allow panning/moving of the camera. Just as a disclaimer, I made this because it's cool, not because I spent lots of time on it, on the contrary, it's taken from the three.js 3D Canvas library floor demo with a 3 line change to make it pull a function from the URL.
