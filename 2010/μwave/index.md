μwave is the first true third-party wave client which is compatible with Google Wave. It’s free to use at [http://micro-wave.appspot.com/](http://micro-wave.appspot.com/) and works great on mobile devices. It supports searching for waves, opening them and writing replies.

The source code for the server component is open-source and can be [found on github](http://gist.github.com/417035) (though it’s slightly outdated, but the important stuff is there). It’s fairly simple (It’s based on the original [example code](http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/python/oauth/example/client.py) so I’m going to have the same MIT license), but one of the few python scripts which can do authentication with google and pass commands to the data api.  It relies on the[Python OAuth Library](http://oauth.googlecode.com/svn/code/python/oauth/).

A list of posts related to this can be [found here](category/wave-2/microwave-wave-2/).
