**Edit mode** is no longer experimental, a new implementation includes a tiny diff engine which allows editing a post without necessarily destroying layout. Root blip editing is now possible. There is a new** tag list** on the bottom of each wave, also including an "Add Tag" button. **Search results** are now formatted with modification date, number of blips, number of unread blips and read/unread state. There is a new **settings panel** when you click the logo. Added support for the internet exploder browser starting at version six. Owner_utils is a setting which adds utilities like "set everyone as read only". The New Wave feature no longer creates pop-up prompts, but rather silently creates and opens an empty wave. It renders the live-editing cursors. There is a **new multipane interface** for desktop. Gadget support has greatly improved. It handles rotation on a mobile webkit device better. It now uses Wave Data/Robots Protocol 0.22 and **renders using the newly exposed conversation model**.
