If you run <tt>chrome --enable-apps</tt> and install it, you _might_ be able to see an icon and magically be able to use the app offline. Or wait until the webstore is finally released and then you can just install it.

**Edit July 10, 2010:** Actually it was a while ago, but now the app works again and automatically restores the last state using localstorage.
