On December 15th, 2012 12:15pm, I was accepted Early Action to theÂ Massachusetts Institute of Technology, so I'll be there starting this fall :)

This blog isn't principally here to boost my ego, so I'll leave it at that, because I'm writing this post some six months after-the-fact with a fake retroactive timestamp in order to fraud my monthly post-count goal.
