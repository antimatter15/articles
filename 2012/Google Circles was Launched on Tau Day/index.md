I realized this a while ago, June 29th and started this blog post and never got around to filling it with content, but I'm pretty sure the the title can stand on its own. For those unfamiliar with [tau](http://tauday.com/), there's this movement that says that pi is a bad circle constant - since more often than not, mathematical equations use 2pi rather than pi, and for purity sake, that should be the value for the circle constant.

Google+ was launched on June 28, 2011 (or at least that was the day the limited field testing began, but I was part of that, so that's the date I consider). In other words, 6/28, or 6.28.
