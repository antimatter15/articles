The ajax animator is going through a major milestone update, but it's not very subtle.

Normally, updates to the site take less than 30 minutes, but this time it's taken a whole 24 hours and counting.

The codebase is much better, but the compilier, the program that I made to create the finalized, optimized product, is working very crappily.
