<span class="postbody">Okay, so one day i felt crazy and changed everything by 1 decimal place because i don't want this to seem misleadingly good. I mean, if it hits a 1.0 release, then some people would think it's almost as good as Flash 1 (futuresplash animator) which it it isn't even near yet.</span>

So it should be 1.5 but now it's 0.15 :D

Read more to find out the whole list, a summary of it would be axml2, UI polishing, save space, nicer code (but still hideous), css, users, tweening, finish partially completed ideas etc.

<span class="postbody">What's done so far </span>

*   Redesigned Register UI
*   Save Lots of code
*   New Save/Open file format (around 5x faster, and 10 times smaller)
*   Relocating stuff
*   interactive tutorials
*   Backwards Compat Mode
*   for the first time it's gonna be a legitimate GPLv2 project (I'm gonna include the gpl.txt file for once)
*   replaced wz_tooltips with native ext.js ones
*   Change save file to computer architecture
*   change organization of Save/Open buttons in file menu (submenus)
*   optimized stuff
*   fixed bugs
*   No more save/open window (now, single-purpose dialog alerts, much better)
*   Progress bars
*   User friendly upload error message (yay!)
*   relocate css
*   delete lot's of stuff from user-management
*   REAL SUPPORT FOR LINES/ELLIPSES, lines didn't work for tweening, ellipses didn't work for tweening or flash, and ALL suffered from a programming error causing line-widths to be messed up.
*   FastMode
...and more to come
