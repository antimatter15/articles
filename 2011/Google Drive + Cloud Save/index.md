Google Drive launched a little less than a week ago and has introduced itself as something of a mere Dropbox clone. But I really think it has some potential for differentiating itself from Dropbox in the longer run by integrating some of the functionality of Cloud Save. I guess it's sort of alluded to by the actual name, a Drive does more than just act as a keep safe for certain intended files, but rather wholly replaces everything. It's the next logical step for Cloud Save that I certainly can't take it to, deduplicating all the files on the internet so that online and offline are absolutely seamless.
