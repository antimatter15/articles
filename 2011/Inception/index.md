This post is going to be nothing like any other post, because it's going to be about the video frame at the 650th second of the movie Inception.

[![](Screen-shot-2011-07-10-at-11.12.21-PM-300x160.png "Screen shot 2011-07-10 at 11.12.21 PM")](Screen-shot-2011-07-10-at-11.12.21-PM.png)

With a bit of [Googling](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22the%20changes%20in%20photoluminescence%20of%20arrays%20of%22&amp), it seems the first part of this document is "Development of Highly Sensitive Portable Hydrocarbon Sensors" by  [Dr. Michael Carpenter](http://www.utrc2.org/directory/people.php?viewid=70) at the [State University of New York](http://www.utrc2.org/directory/partners.php?viewid=27).

Here follows the text of the document taken from http://www.utrc2.org/research/projects.php?viewid=155 marked up to correspond with the appearance of the document in Inception. The second part of the document in the frame does not appear to be from the same source and I've encountered difficulty in locating the source of that part of the document. The visible differences between the source document and the image from Inception are in bold while the redacted contents are in strikeout. The newlines are approximately where they are in the visible document.

And so the question is: Is there a specific reason that the secret document was of hydrocarbon detection? What does this have to do with the movie? Is there any significance of the redacted text?
