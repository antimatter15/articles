I just got accepted into beta for it, and it's insanely great! There are some disconnect issues, but the latency is awesome, etc. If only syntax hightlighting was better.

And yes, i'm killing their servers by contributing to their [viral](http://etherpad.com/ep/blog/posts/etherpad-temporarily-reverts-to-closed-beta) growth :P

as a sidenote, i'm actually hyperlinking my links! (freaky, I know), and my posts are getting less and less mature over the months/years
