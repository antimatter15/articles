great news! subversion works now! again! cool right? 

Again, you can access the code repositry at http://ajaxanimator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ajaxanimator

if you haven't noticed, i've changed the directory structure yet again! from Animator2 to ajaxanimator. so when I upload it to my server, there'll be a nice human-readable url: ajaxanimator/build. not too complex, not too long, consise and informative. telling you that the app is the ajax animator, and you're using the compiled version. Unlike the old one which was /Animator/html/ajaxanimator-compressed.htm where you have no idea what to call it.... is it simply "Animator" or "ajaxanimator", okay, so its compressed. now what? There is random unnecessary repeatition of data, animator is in it twice, and htm==html...

I've also decided to change how I version things. Don't worry, it'll still be 0.2\. But i'm not going to make the version subversion commit # / 100 anymore. I noticed that when I commit/build things, its not something I do very often. When i commit the most frequently, its when I'm doing nothing important, small fixes and such. So it throws it off. since it should ideally be valued by the amount of features added/improved and such... not by whether i remember to compile. So, now i'll set the version numbers in my head, i'll be 0.21 when I feel like it.
