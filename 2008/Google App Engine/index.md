I'm gonna try signing up for Google App Engine, and migrate the project there. If and when this happens, I will likely rewrite the entire server backend to be powered by python. This is a good thing, as I might be able to use http://pyswftools.sourceforge.net/examples.html, which is clearly quite amazing.
