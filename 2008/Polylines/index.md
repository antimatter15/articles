Ajax Animator will be able to support polylines probably by 0.17 (0.16 is just a UI revamp)

All the client-code necessary for polylines are now fully functional because of the brilliant work of [josep_ssv](../../profile.php?lookup=79). The server-side generation system still has to be implemented (along with the tweening engine, which shoudnt be that hard since all necesssary is looping thorugh the values and applying a transformation)
