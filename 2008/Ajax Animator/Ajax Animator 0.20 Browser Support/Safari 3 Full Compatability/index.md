As in http://antimatter15.110mb.com/phpfusion/news.php?readmore=26 there was a bug where though I claimed support for Safari 3, it wouldn't work. Well that (as outlined in detail) because I had done some extreme compression on the prototype library, which I never tested (couldn't) on a Safari 3 installation.

It has now been fixed.
