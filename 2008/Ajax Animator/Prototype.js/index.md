Well, this blog was *failing* the website optimization test, because for some reason, it would load prototype.js?v=1.6.0 in EVERY PAGE! I looked around on the interwebs and discovered it was because of this plugin named Optimize DB. I removed it, and magically my page load was 1/2 of its size. That plugin sucked anyway, it made me constantly feel like pressing the "Optimize" button just to shave off 1 byte from my DB!!!

I might try porting the Prototype/Script.Aculo.Us used in the articles/pages (from the theme) to some other (lighter) framework (jQuery? Animator.js? Nothing?).
