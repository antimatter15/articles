A main factor to the project not being as good as it can be, is that there are no *good* flash-generation tools that fit my needs. Currently, i do not have the money to buy a dedicated server or so to install Ming on, or etc. I have this free shared web host (which i have to say is fine).

Is there anyone that can improve the freemovie library? Or write a new one?
