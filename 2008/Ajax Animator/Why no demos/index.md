I'm sure quite a few of you are wondering why there aren't any good demos of what the Ajax Animator can do. The answer is simple: I can't draw. Interesting eh? I actually started this project so I could do stick figure animations better. Its pretty sad, I know. And the most sad part is: the ajax animator is really glitchy with lines :( !!!

The good news, is that some user-made FAQ/Manual/Tutorial stuff may be arriving tomorrow.
