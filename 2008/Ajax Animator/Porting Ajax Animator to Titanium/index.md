So the issue with Adobe AIR, is that there's no SVG support, but I have a hunch that [this](http://titaniumapp.com/) might support SVG, as it's not Adobe's fork of Webkit, but hopefully the *real* one :)

It has tons of awesome components like WebKit, Chromium (hope it doesn't have that rotate bug...), Gears, GTK+, jQuery, Appcelerator SDK, NSIS, Ruby.

But this will hopefully satisfy those wishes for a Desktop version.
