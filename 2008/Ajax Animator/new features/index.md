Okay, so I'm polishing the app alot today. Right now, I'm setting the app up for a release some time this week.

I added framerate support to the Ajax Animator's Format. I also added some messages for Help-&gt;Bugs, Help-&gt;Comments, and I renamed Help-&gt;Donate to Help-&gt;Contribute.

Help-&gt;Manual shows a page that says "Manual Currently Unavailable" and Help-&gt;FAQ actually shows a working page (OMG!)

Help-&gt;About now reports that the Ajax Animator is at "Beta RC1" Stability, and its no longer a "testing" release.

Please test things out and report bugs if you can :)
