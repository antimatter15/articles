Today, I've launched the new site. My new blog. We're starting over. I don't know what to do exactly. I just hope that everyone can adjust to this new site. I like it more, it may be somewhat faster - at least my spam problem will be fixed.

If you still wan to visit the old site, feel free to do so at [http://antimatter15.110mb.com/phpfusion](http://antimatter15.110mb.com/phpfusion) everything will still be perfectly accessible, and feel free to register there. If this doesn't work out, i could revert back to phpfusion. But I think the move is for the better.

Please, Really, post your thoughts as a comment to this post. Please, I beg of you.
