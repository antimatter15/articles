### Action Limit Exceeded

#### What happened?

<div style="margin-right: 25%;">

You have performed the requested action too many times in a 24-hour time period. Or, you have performed the requested action too many times since the creation of your account.

We place limits on the number of actions that can be performed by each user in order to reduce the potential for abuse. We feel that we have set these limits high enough that legitimate use will very rarely reach them. Without these limits, a few abusive users could degrade the quality of this site for everyone.
<div style="margin: 2em;">
<div class="bubble_bg" style="background-color: #c3d9ff; margin-bottom: 0.6em;">
<div id="bub" class="box-inner" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px 3px;">**Your options:**

*   Wait 24 hours and then try this action again.
*   Ask another member of your project to perform the action for you.
*   [Contact us](mailto:google-code-hosting@googlegroups.com)for further assistance.
