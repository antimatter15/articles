I'm just getting used to linux. Its not too different, and compiz-fusion is really distracting (but awesome!) I feel a bit more productive, as things are a lot faster, and much of the stuff is more stable.

Sadly, I really miss TortoiseSVN (i'm probably gonna switch to KDE eventually, but its a freaking huge download).

I just tested out my Compiler, and woah, the speeds are freaking amazing. On Windows+XAMPP, i actually have to wait ~5 seconds after I hit the "Compile" button for everything to work. here on linux, its instantaneous! 

I'm working on the bugs that kermeros reported now. but I just wanted to post that I actually got ubuntu working.
