I've gotten a sourceforge page for the project: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ajaxanimator and the site is at http://ajaxanimator.sf.net/ where you can browse the latest source code. I'll probably still use Google Code, and i'll probably also use Google App Engine and sourceforge together.

And that Google Ajax Libraries thing looks pretty nice. Can't wait till it supports Ext.
