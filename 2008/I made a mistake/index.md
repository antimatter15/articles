While developing on the linux platform, I managed to get Opera to be supported, since Safari doesn't work on linux (or wine), and i was unable to compile webkit from svn, i wrongfully assumed that Safari would still work. I just tested it out on Safari 3 and it turns out it doesn't work. The problem is all in prototype.superlite.js (my hacked together version of Prototype.js)
