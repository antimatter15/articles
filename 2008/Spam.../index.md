I'm getting a lot of spam (it's showing up on my Akismet filter) on this blog now. I usually only get a few (~5) trackback spams (no comment spam). But now, I'm getting ~11 trackback messages OVERNIGHT, and I'm getting a few comment spams (basically unheardof). Just like two weeks ago I hit a TOTAL of 500 spam, now it's close to 1200.

Strangely enough, I'm actually pretty happy of this. Spam is an indication of people actually visiting it. Even though virtually nobody comments (still a lot more than the early days of the blog).

And the stuff at http://antimatter15.110mb.com/phpfusion/ is really spammy now :( I built a quick-n-dirty spam filter for it, and it's database is over 7mb !!!!
