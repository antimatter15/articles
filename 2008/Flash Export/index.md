Okay, i've done it. You can now export to flash. But the problem now is that I'm still using the uber limited freemovie library, which is both outdated and incapable of anything besides the rectangles and lines.

For now, I haven't installed the server files yet so it wont work until I do, but by the time you read this, I may have already done it.
