I got some keyboard shortcuts implemented. Most of them are just copied off Adobe's book, so it shouldn't be too hard to learn.

Here is the list (you can grab it off the **Help-&gt;Keyboard Shortcuts** and you can see i'm bolding the button labels like in KDE's Tip of The Day boxes)

<span id="ext-gen2055" class="ext-mb-text">**F5** Insert Frame
**F6** To Keyframe
**F7** Empty Frame
**Enter** Preview/Play
**Page Up** Go to Previous Frame
**Page Down** Go to Next frame
**Ctrl+C** Copy
**Ctrl+X** Cut
**Ctrl+V** Paste
**Ctrl+Z** Undo
**Ctrl+Shift+Z** Redo</span>
