today was just a few fixes, a pseudo-key-guide thing ported from the current stable one, and some minor updates. I included the Ext.ux.ColorPicker, and I guess i'll work on porting OnlyPaths to Ext soon (it currently uses Prototype). I'm probably not going to include Prototype because OnlyPaths is a *much* (~11x) larger project than RichDraw, and therefore, it is mainly out of trying to improve size. (the project is currently ~20kb, but with onlypaths, will become ~100kb, plus ExtJS, will be ~1mb)

I might set up a blag and a separate site for the Ajax Animator (based off my alpha site from last release). I'm thinking of using WordPress/PHPBB but idk
