I currently successfully installed/configured WordPress, and [painstakingly] copied every article from phpfusion. I have installed PHPBB3, but am not done converting the forums. After that, I will install WP-United, and configure the gallery/etc. 

The good thing, is that there are lots of advantages to wordpress over php-fusion, including being able to use a desktop blogging application, and making it my personal blog, versus the homepage for my one project.

I might have to install PHPBB2 in order to use the php-fusion converter, then upgrade to PHPBB3... I donno.

_EDIT: I might use WphpBB instead_
