You can now import/export animations through a sweet GUI. As expected, just go to File-&gt;Save-&gt;As Text to see. You can open it from File-&gt;Open-&gt;From Text (as in the directions in the window).

If you try loading malformed or  AXML data, it reports a nice, human-readable error saying either the data is malformed, check for corruption, or try again. or that the data is of an old version and can't be imported.
