No time, copied from SVN commit message:
> Working Menu-&gt;File-&gt;Save-&gt;To Computer button. Does ajax request to save_proxy.php (new file) and if the request fails to output the correct stuff, it falls back to the local client based dataURI method (btw, won't work on IE).>

It currently will fail and definitively will fall back to the dataURI method now because I haven't installed the new save_proxy.php on the testing server. Will do that tomorrrow, I dont have time now.
