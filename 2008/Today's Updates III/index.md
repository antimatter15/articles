I added the beginnings of the Users system. There is an accordian panel for switching between Register and Login. The Login panel has the standard Username and Password (labeled User/Pass). The Registration panel is the same, with 2 instances of "Pass". As every other panel in the app, there are nice little silk icons that accompany them.
