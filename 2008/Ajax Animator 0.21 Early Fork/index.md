Okay, I've started working on Ajax Animator 0.21, right now, its just a different version with one bug fix. btw, its the one where you can't reopen the About dialog after it's been opened and closed (with the little X, not the "close" button)

BTW, it's at http://antimatter15.110mb.com/ajaxanimator/testing/build/

EDIT
Okay, I fixed another bug where the tip of the day won't open again after closed like the about window one. I also made it so you can minimize the tips window.

I also fixed the bug reported by Kermeros where Undo works improperly after File-&gt;New
