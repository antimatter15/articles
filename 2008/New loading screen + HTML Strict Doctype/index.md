The application is now HTML (I just added a doctype) and I changed the loading screen almost completely stolen from the Ext Samples page. (HTML Strict sort of broke the other one). I think one day, it'll be XHTML. but now it's just HTML Strict. Now it's more descriptive. Saying "Loading UI..." and "Initializing..." rather than a simple "loading". Its one of the ways to make it feel to load faster.
