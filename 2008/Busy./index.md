I've been somewhat busy in the last few days, I'm using a new computer now, its quite a bit faster, but doesn't do everything that the old computer did, and I'm doing a lot for it to catch up.

its also a fresh start anyway, so I guess I can try out new tools/etc (still using the ol eclipse though!).
