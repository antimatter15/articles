I added the timeline tooltip again, so it details the number of shapes on any given frame easily through a mouse-over. I greatly reduced the number of event listeners added by using more event bubbling. It now distinguishes between Preview and Canvas Mode (previously known as Draw Mode) in the Animation menu.
