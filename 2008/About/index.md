I'm really not that interesting. This blog is just a place where I talk about random ideas or projects like just about everyone else.

<!--more-->

I've never really been into talking about myself, rather just the stuff I do or think. I may be somewhat paranoid, or whatever.  I think I'm an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTP">INTP</a> but I'm not too certain (could my subconscious be deceiving me?).

If you're more interested on the history of this blog, well, it started a long time ago. I started with <a href="http://php-fusion.co.uk/news.php">phpfusion</a> as my CMS (and <a href="http://110mb.com">110mb</a> as my host) back in late May 2007, and switched to <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> and <a href="http://phpbb.org/">phpBB</a> in mid-2008. Later the year, I got a new web host, <a title="THIS HOST SUCKS!" href="http://godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a>, but the blog didn't migrate there. Just a few days later I switched from phpBB to <a href="http://bbpress.org">BBPress</a>. From then to Mid-July 2009, I upgraded to WordPress 2.8 and migrated to a <a href="http://dreamhost.com">new host</a>.

This blog initially was for the sole purpose of hosting changelogs for the Ajax Animator project (which itself began sometime before March of 2007).

Before this blog, I had several sites starting with a simple Google Page Creator one from 2005. After that I made a <a href="http://www.jupiterportal.org/">Jupiter CMS</a> powered site and later used <a href="http://joomla.org">Joomla</a> after experimenting with <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>. After moving to 110mb, I used <a href="http://php-fusion.co.uk/news.php">phpfusion</a> because people on the forums seem to like it. Now I'm on wordpress (and repeating whatever I wrote 2 paragraphs above)!

This about page is pretty much the way it was in 2008, and it's kind of weird to think that that was over half a decade ago.

If you want to contact me, my email's <strong>antimatter15@gmail.com</strong> I'd really appreciate it if nobody sent spambots after me.
