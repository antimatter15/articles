It's still 11:35 AM here, so this is likely not all that will be here today. But there are some great new features today. Renaming the layers through the GUI will actually rename layers in the back-end too. There is a combobox for the zoom sizes in both the canvas and preview tabs. There is now a slider for adjusting line width on the panel.
