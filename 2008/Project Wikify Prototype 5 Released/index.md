I just released Project Wikify prototype 5 revision 9\. The highlights are support for 'Channels" which let you have your own private "fork" of the internet. Also, Full IE support, and a completely redesigned website. On the backend, there's a new communication protocol. Saving is only done through POST, no more JSONP/GET stuff. Loading is done differently too.

Again, you can get it from [http://wikify.antimatter15.com ](http://wikify.antimatter15.com)

As with all the major updates before, the database was trashed in the process.
