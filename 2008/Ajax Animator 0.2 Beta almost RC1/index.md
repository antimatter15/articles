Okay, sorta  a weird name for a release right? Beta _and_ Release Canidate? Well, its Web 2.0/Ajax so really, anything can happen. I sure hope this doesn't spark an onsalought of Stable Beta RC1 Pre-Alpha Unstable Full releases.

But... yeah. Tonight I added two very important features stemming from Properties.

the first is properties itself (duh). It allows you to change canvas Width, Height, and the animation framerate. Stemming from this, is the new feature in the Ajax Animator Format (ALEON, AXON, AXION, AJSON, AXFF, AFF or whatever you want to call it), you guessed it: Width/Height. Oh crap. I just remembered that it doesn't support framerate yet. CRAP! oh. hmm. i'll just post it anyway and continue from here when I get that feature done.
