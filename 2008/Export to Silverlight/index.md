You can export your animations to silverlight, almost flawlessly (though i'm on a linux box so I never tested them, they're hopefully close to the Silverlight 1.0 specs).

The only problem, is that I have no idea how to put an animation in silverlight. Right now, it'll squish every frame's data together. into a merged display of every frame.
