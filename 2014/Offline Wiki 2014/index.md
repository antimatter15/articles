It was in 2008 when I got my first phone, an iPhone— the *original* iPhone. 

Actually, to say that it was a phone might have been generous, because in fact, I had an unlocked iPhone with no associated cellular plan (In fact, I wouldn't graduate to the ability of being able to _call_ people for another 3 years). I was cursed to roam the earth for sketchy WiFi hotspots to feed an insatiable addiction to information.

It's hard to imagine (for me, at least) that that was all over 6 years ago— right at the dawn of the smartphone era. Apple's iOS didn't at the time support copy/paste, and didn't allow third party apps, insisting instead that the web was the next great app platform. 

But what Apple had then neglected in the pursuit of idealism was picked up by the hacker community.
